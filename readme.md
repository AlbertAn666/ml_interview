# Toy ML Models
Just make myself familiar with ml coding interview and pytorch  
  
**multimodal**  
Generate embedding with CLIP by make_coco_clip_embeddings.py and RQ-VAE to generate 3 level semantic id  
main_train.py to train and save checkpoint, inference.py for inferencing  

**llm**
Toy generative model, pre-train pipeline

**regression**
regression models
